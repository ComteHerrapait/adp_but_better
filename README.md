This project aims to improve the experience of using mon.adp.com to clock in and out of work.  
It provides an interactive command line experience. Which is not especially usefully, but it's fun to make. And this is the main goal of this project : automating something boring while allowing me to have fun with Python.  
I also try to implement workflows as a test to gain experience using them.
